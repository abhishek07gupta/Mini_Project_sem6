# Mini_Project_sem6

We have worked to solve the problem of the layman who need to edit his videos especially Podcasts.

Here we are taking the multiple videos , then merging them togethter to get the final output video which shows the clips only where someone is speaking cutting the other clip.

We are also adding the captions to the final output clip , which makes the final video more accessiblle for the final viewer.
